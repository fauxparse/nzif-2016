NZIF 2016 Code of Conduct
=========================

The New Zealand Improv Festival is governed by the New Zealand Improvisation
Trust. Our principles, as laid out in our trust deed:

> **3.** The Trust is committed, in attaining its purposes, to
>
> > **3.1.** supporting, creating and presenting work that is accessible, diverse, and
> > respectful of our practitioners and our audience; and
> >
> > **3.2.** maintaining the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.

NZIF therefore asks all participating in our workshops, performances,
networking and social events to commit to these principles, to respect each
other and our audience, and to maintain professionalism and integrity. We are
all ambassadors of our community and should behave accordingly.

In addition we are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body type, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
festival participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. This applies both to performance and
teaching. We are aware that you are working in the moment and that sometimes
inappropriate things come out (especially in workshops), and sometimes audience
suggestions will be less than savoury. We trust that you will use your
professional judgement as teachers and performers to ensure the work we present
does not become inappropriate or harmful. Remember, you are not obliged to
accept audience suggestions that do not inspire you or that will lead to work
that falls outside of these guidelines.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
jokes are not appropriate for the New Zealand Improv Festival, both onstage and
off.

When onsite at any festival venue (BATS Theatre and Lumen, social events at
bars, workshops/events at any other venue) please attend safety briefings where
relevant, adhere to all safety guidelines, and follow any and all instructions
given by venue management and festival staff. Respect the alcohol license at
BATS and other venues. Be on time and prepared for shows, call times, and
workshops. Respect the facilities. Report any hazards or accidents promptly and
honestly. Be a good neighbour. Make the festival look good.

If you would like to report or discuss any situations such as above, you have
several ports of call: Jennifer Oâ€™Sullivan, Clare Kerrison, Matt Powell, or your
own director or teacher. Any of the festival team will assist in the short term.
All discussions will be kept confidential unless otherwise agreed. You are
welcome to include a support person at any stage (and they do not have to be
involved in the festival). Contact information for the festival team will be
provided in your participant pack.

Consequences for breaching the Code of Conduct will be commensurate with the
severity of the situation, and may include: apologies to affected parties, fines
where financial loss has been incurred, exclusion from events, removal from the
festival without refund, and being asked not to return in future. All decisions
with regards to such situations are at the sole discretion of the festival
organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
